Why are templates helpful?

For several reasons, such as:

Keeping server logic (in this case JavaScript) separate from markup (HTML), making it easier to modify or debug one without affecting the other
Separating different parts of an HTML document into different files, helping keep the length of HTML files short and manageable

Embedded JavaScript templates (EJS) can be used as an alternative template engine.
